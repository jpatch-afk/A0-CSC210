Reflection on your experience with this assignment:

It was certainly difficult to try a new type of thinking. I also haven't coded in Java for a while as I did CSC120 last Fall, so it took a bit of time to re-introduce some of the syntax, but I got a handle on it soon enough. I was a bit confused with some of the instructions, but after a bit of explanation from going to office hours, I feel like I have followed them to the best of my ability. I feel like I have a better understanding of Arrays and how their methods function as well as sequences and how they can be initialized as well.
